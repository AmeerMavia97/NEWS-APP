        Engineering is a discipline and profession that applies scientific, mathematical, and technological <br>
        knowledge to design, analyze, develop, and improve structures, machines, systems, processes, and devices <br>
        to meet specific needs and solve practical problems. Engineers use their expertise to create and implement <br>
        practical solutions for various fields such as civil engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical <br>
        engineering, chemical engineering, and many others.
