    <div>
        Cybersecurity, also known as computer security or information security, is the practice of protecting <br>
        computer systems, networks, devices, and data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, <br>
        modification, or destruction. It involves implementing measures to prevent and detect potential threats <br>
        and vulnerabilities to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of digital information.

    <div>
        With the increasing reliance on digital technologies and the interconnected nature of the internet, cybersecurity <br>
        has become a critical concern for individuals, businesses, governments, and organizations of all sizes. <br>
        Cyber threats can come in various forms, including malicious software (malware), phishing attacks, hacking <br>
        attempts, data breaches, identity theft, and more.

        The field of cybersecurity encompasses a wide range of technologies, processes, and practices to safeguard <br>
        digital systems and data. Some key aspects of cybersecurity include:
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>Risk Assessment: Identifying and assessing potential risks, vulnerabilities, and threats to determine <br>
                the level of protection required for a system or network.</li>
            <li>Security Architecture: Designing and implementing security measures, protocols, and infrastructure <br>
                to protect against unauthorized access and malicious activities.</li>
            <li>Access Control: Managing user privileges and controlling access to systems, networks, and data to ensure that only authorized individuals can access and manipulate sensitive information.</li>
            <li>Cryptography: Using cryptographic techniques to encrypt and decrypt data, ensuring secure communication and protecting data integrity.</li>
            <li>Network Security: Implementing firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and other technologies to secure network infrastructure and defend against unauthorized access and attacks.</li>
            <li>Incident Response: Developing strategies and protocols to respond to and mitigate security incidents, including identifying, containing, and recovering from cyber threats or breaches.</li>
            <li>Security Awareness and Training: Educating users and employees about cybersecurity best practices, policies, and procedures to foster a security-conscious culture and reduce human error vulnerabilities.</li>
            <li>Vulnerability Management: Regularly scanning systems for vulnerabilities, applying patches and updates, and conducting security audits to proactively address potential weaknesses.</li>
            <li>Threat Intelligence: Monitoring and analyzing the evolving threat landscape to stay informed about emerging threats and developing effective countermeasures.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        Given the ever-increasing frequency and sophistication of cyber threats, cybersecurity is a critical field that encompasses both preventive measures and reactive strategies to safeguard digital assets and ensure the privacy, integrity, and availability of information in an interconnected world.
