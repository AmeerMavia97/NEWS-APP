    <center><h1>MACHINE LEARNING</h1></center>
    <hr>
<p>
    Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms <br>
 
    and statistical models that enable computers to learn and make predictions <br>or decisions without being
    explicitly programmed. It is concerned with the development of computer systems <br>that can learn from and
    analyze large amounts of data, recognize <br> patterns, and make intelligent decisions or predictions based on 
    that data 
</p>
<p>
    Instead of relying on explicit instructions, machine learning algorithms are designed to learn from <br>
    data and improve their performance over time. They use statistical techniques to identify patterns <br>
    and relationships within the data, and then use these patterns to make predictions or take actions. <br>
    The learning process involves the algorithm adjusting its internal parameters <br>
    or model based on the available data to improve its performance on a specific task or problem <br>
</p>
<p>
    The process of machine learning typically involves the following steps:<br>
</p>   
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>Data collection: Gathering relevant data that contains information about the problem or task at hand.</li>
        <li>Data preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis, which may involve removing noise, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a suitable format.</li>
        <li>Feature extraction: Identifying and selecting the most relevant features or attributes from the data that are likely to influence the output or prediction.</li>
        <li>Model selection and training: Choosing an appropriate machine learning algorithm or model that is capable of learning from the data and then training it on the available data.</li>
        <li>Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained model by using a separate set of data called the test set. This step helps in estimating how well the model is likely to perform on unseen data.</li>
        <li>Prediction or decision making: Once the model has been trained and evaluated, it can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data or to make decisions based on the learned patterns.</li>
    </ol>
</p>
    Machine learning techniques can be broadly categorized into supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning:
    <br>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Supervised learning: In this approach, the model learns from labeled examples, where the input data is accompanied by corresponding correct outputs or labels. The goal is to learn a mapping function that can predict the correct output for new, unseen inputs.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Unsupervised learning: Here, the model learns patterns and structures from unlabeled data without any specific guidance. The objective is to discover hidden patterns or relationships within the data.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Reinforcement learning: This approach involves an agent learning to make decisions or take actions in an environment to maximize a cumulative reward signal. The agent learns through trial and error, receiving feedback on its actions and adjusting its strategy accordingly.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <br>
    Machine learning has found applications in various domains, such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, autonomous vehicles, fraud detection, and many more. Its ability to handle large amounts of data and extract valuable insights has made it a powerful tool in solving complex problems and driving advancements in AI
